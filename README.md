# Nbody-Simulation

# This program to simulates the motion of n particles in the plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animates the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems.2 classes, Planet.java and NBody.java work together to simulate the rotation of the planets in the solar system in a plane.
